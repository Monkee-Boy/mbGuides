# mbGuides

This is a collection of coding standards, best practices, and resources for the Monkee-Boy Dev Team. The goal of these guides is to create a set of standards used on all projects. This makes it easier when maintaining projects long term for each developer.

The coding standards should be followed for all projects. The only exception would be when using a third party library such as Twitter Bootstrap and utilizing their standards instead. This guide will be updated as often as needed as the development team grows.

### Tasks

- [ ] Expand JavaScript section from AirBnB's guide.
- [ ] Expand upon using SASS.
- [ ] Add more detailed Accessibility section.
- [ ] Add SEO Guide (this will extend on the typical title/alt tags and include more meta and schema.org info).
- [ ] Add guide for mbCMS including plugin/file structure, naming convention of plugins and urls, and standards used in it. Pending completion of the CMS.
- [ ] Clean up ./backend-standards.md and extend for CakePHP standards. This will be a collaboration with Pete.
- [ ] Add info on naming conventions for files and images.

### Credit & Thanks

These guides are maintained by the Monkee-Boy Dev Team and primarily for internal use. The guides are made public on github to share. These guides are heavily inspired by the Mozilla Developer Network, Necolas' Idiomatic CSS, Chris Coyier, Paul Irish and many more in the developer community. These guides are not a fit for every team, you should encourage the use of standards within your team for the greater good and these guides are what works for us.
